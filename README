Implements a tiny shell with job control. Main file is tsh.c, other files are programs that can be run inside the shell to test functionality. Written by me and Chris Lee.

Allows for concurrent job processing, with foreground/background separation. Can check all running jobs, pause/unpause jobs with their PID, and terminate them. Eval is the main function,checks console input for builtin commands, else assumes input is a program to be executed. Masks signals to prevent datarace and forks a child process, then passes the input to child process, waiting if foreground, else prints job information and continues waiting for more console input.
